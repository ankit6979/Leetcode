# Comptetive Programming Repository
Welcome to my Comptetive Programming repository! This is where I document my journey to improve my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking by tackling data structure and algorithm problems on various platforms.

## About
I'm committed to solving at least one problem every day. This repository serves as:
* A personal log of my progress
* A collection of solutions for reference
* A way to share my solutions and learn from others

## Repository Structure
* Platforn_name: Each problem is organized into a separate folder named based on the platform with the date and a short problem name.
* Topics: This contains the different topics that the problem was part of and also a refrence to the problem. 

## How to Use this Repository

* Browse problems: Look through the folders to find specific problems you're interested in.
* Learn from solutions: Read my solution code and the explanation (if available) to understand the approach and implementation.
* Contribute: Feel free to suggest improvements to my solutions, point out errors, or provide alternative solutions. Pull requests are welcome!

## Disclaimer
* My solutions may not always be the most optimal or efficient. I'm constantly learning and improving.
* Feel free to use my solutions as inspiration, but I encourage you to try solving the problems yourself first.

## Additional Notes
The goal is to focus on the learning process and continuous improvement, not just solving the problem quickly.
Let's learn and grow together!
